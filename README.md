## PWAInfo
The [PWAInfo](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-MacOS/tree/base-project/MacOSpwa/PWAinfo) directory contains a sample manifest and image icons of various requried sizes. [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com) will be modified so that it replaces the sample manifest and image icons with those of your own PWA. 

For tips on creating app icons specifically for Mac OS, see [Apple's App Icon Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/icons-and-images/app-icon/).
