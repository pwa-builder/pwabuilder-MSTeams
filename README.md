## PWA Builder MSTeams Integrations

MSTeams integration platform module for [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com), a tool for creating progressive web applications based on a [W3C Web App Manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/).

## Sample App
The proof of concept, located in the [poc](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-MSTeams/tree/base-project/poc) directory, loads a given website in the Macintosh application window.

## PWAInfo
The [PWAInfo](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-MSTeams/tree/base-project/MSTeamspwa/PWAinfo) directory contains a sample manifest and image icons of various requried sizes. [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com) will be modified so that it replaces the sample manifest and image icons with those of your own PWA.
